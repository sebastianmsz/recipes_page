                Water Preparation:
                Begin by ensuring your water is clean and filtered for the best-tasting ice cubes. If your tap water doesn't taste great on its own, your ice cubes won't either.
            <li>
                Ice Cube Tray Selection:
                Choose a clean ice cube tray. Silicone trays are excellent for easy removal, but any tray will work.
                Carefully pour water into each compartment of the ice cube tray, leaving a little space at the top for expansion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leveling the Tray:
                Gently tap the filled tray on the counter to remove any air bubbles and ensure the water is level in each compartment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Freezing:
                Place the tray in the freezer and let it freeze completely. This typically takes a few hours.
            </li>   
            <li>
                Removing the Ice Cubes:
                Once the ice cubes are fully frozen, remove the tray from the freezer. To release the ice cubes, twist or tap the tray gently.
            </li>
            <li>
                Storage:
                Transfer the ice cubes to a clean, airtight container if you don't plan to use them immediately. This prevents them from absorbing any unwanted odors from the freezer.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
