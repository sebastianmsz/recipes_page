                    Watch the Bubbles:
                    As the water heats up, observe the formation of bubbles at the bottom and sides of the pot. Wait for a vigorous rolling boil.

                    Turn Off the Heat:
                    Once the water reaches a rolling boil, promptly turn off the heat source. <strong>Avoid overboiling</strong>, as it may alter the taste and texture of the water.
