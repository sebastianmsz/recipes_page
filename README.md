# Odin HTML Practice Project - Recipes-Website üçî 
## Project Overview

This project serves as a practical test of my skills in HTML and Git as part of my journey in learning front-end development as a self-taught student while folllowing the  [Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). The goal is to create a website that consists of a main page which will have links to a few recipes using the html alements and Git for version control. **Notice:** This and the other projects from the [Odin Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) won't be updated. This is to keep a record of my learning progress and document how my work was when I started in web development.

## Skills Demonstrated

### HTML
- Structure a webpage using HTML tags.
- Implement various HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, etc...
- Apply attributes and tags to enhance the semantic structure of the content.

### Git
- Initialize a Git repository for version control.
- Stage and commit changes with meaningful commit messages.
- Push changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub.

## Project Structure
The project is organized to showcase a range of HTML elements and structures while maintaining a versioned history using Git. Each significant change or feature may be represented in dedicated branches, allowing for a clear and organized development process.
